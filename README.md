## Project Description
As a fan of the reality TV show "Survivor", I have wanted to make a tabletop game based on it for a long time. With 500 contestants, over 150 challenges and several attributes as crucial for survival the game, the concept may be good for a tabletop game. 
For this card generator I have expended upon what I've learned from making the "Naruto Board Game Card Generator", being able to create more detailed cards.
<br>
<br>
The tabletop game isn't finished yet, but I like the way this program has been shaped.
